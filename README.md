# Find best q value for inference of network gene

Given a gene network generated from in-silico data (for example, generated by works like DOI: 10.1186/1752-0509-5-61), it evaluates the best "q" value for gene inference.

Run it like

python3 read_network_class.py NETWORK

where NETWORK is a gene network time series, stored in folder "test". It will generate a plot showing the best "q" value for inference for each gene.

====================
The "q" value comes from Tsallis Entropy:

$ S_q= \frac{1-\sum p ^q}{1-q}$

where "p" is the probability for one specific gene correlation.

This software looks for the "q" values that gives the minimum entropy value for the correct gene network topology.
